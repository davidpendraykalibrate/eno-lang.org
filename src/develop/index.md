## Roadmap for further implementations

### Python (*enopy*)

[enopy](https://github.com/eno-lang/enopy), the Python implementation, is
already up as a fixed spot right after the ruby implementation reaches a mature
beta status (current projection is mid-summer 2018).

### You name it?

Rust and PHP are likely candidates for late 2018, but what lands on the definite roadmap will also
depend on your feedback, so make yourself heard if you have suggestions or questions!
