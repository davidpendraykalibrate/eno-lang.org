# Libraries

The eno libraries for JavaScript, Python and Ruby are built upon very fast,
dependency-free, custom and pure parser implementations. The growing [eno
benchmark suite](https://github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks/) indicates that eno
parsers by now already outperform most popular toml and yaml parser in
the field in their respective lanugage, even keeping up with parsers utilizing
native C library bindings. (You are welcome to run and extend these benchmarks
on other computers and platforms and/or help to improve the methodology and
code!)

The current main objective for development is to reach full test coverage for
all three platforms - currently 96% (js) 90% (py) 92% (rb) - as well as to confirm
production stability for enopy and enorb in the various running case studies.

## Roadmap for further implementations

Go, Rust, PHP and Java are likely followup candidates for 2018, but what lands on the definite roadmap will also depend on your
feedback, so make yourself heard if you have suggestions or questions!

## Benchmarks

There is now a benchmark suite that evaluates the performance of all eno libraries, also in comparism
against other popular libraries for parsing yaml and toml.

Visit [github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks](https://github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks/) to study these.

## Interactive Demos

This is a work in progress effort to showcase different usecases for eno and the
eno libraries as interactive demos in the browser. Right now there is only a
limited selection of early demos and a draft page layout.
