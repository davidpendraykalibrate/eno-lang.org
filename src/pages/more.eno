- Performance optimization releases enorb 0.4.4 and enopy 0.2.5, both addressing block content parser performance, with [1-16x speed gains for ruby](https://github.com/eno-lang/enorb/blob/4b8332a2a94061c586084c92bb229be6678d77e4/spec/benchmark/analysis.json) and [1-39x speed gains for python](https://github.com/eno-lang/enopy/blob/64fb14979ea881969a317463b37c4f755bfaa497/tests/benchmark/analysis.json)
- Re-evaluated and updated the global benchmark report at [github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks](https://github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks/)
- More optimizations (enorb 0.4.5, enopy 0.2.6), this time addressing token extraction performance, with [1-2.3x speed gains for ruby](https://github.com/eno-lang/enorb/blob/010be1cdc2efc75ee28b06503a8be8bce1ea1bd6/spec/benchmark/analysis.json) and [1-2.5x speed gains for python](https://github.com/eno-lang/enopy/blob/cb87f11593c87d34c287288ed92004c7893688b8/tests/benchmark/analysis.json), [benchmarks](https://github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks/) updated again.

- Improved clarity for some first impression texts on the frontpage (thanks to Dan Haiduc for feedback!).
- New benchmark report at [github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks](https://github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks/) with an additional scenario added that evaluates performance for content-heavy data.
