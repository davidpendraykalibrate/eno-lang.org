- Added unit tests for enopy's tokenization, analysis and resolution error implementations and the Dictionary element implementation, coverage is now up at 52%.
- Fixed a minor issue in enopy's duplicate dictionary entry error implementation.
- Added tons of unit tests to enojs (especially covering error implementations), test suite coverage is now up at 93%.
- Released enojs 0.10.6 with various big and small fixes from the last days.
- Updated the [benchmark report](https://github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks/) with better visual scaling at the top ranking performance field, as well as added explanations.
- Added some test scenarios with wide effect for enorb's html and terminal reporters, catalog messages, as well as the dependency resolver, coverage now up at 93%.
- Released enorb 0.4.7 with a critical fix for the html reporter.

- Performance optimization release enorb 0.4.6, adressing post-opening block consumption and later allocation with [1.25x speed decreases-3x speed gains](https://github.com/eno-lang/enorb/blob/638261d191649b317225a20b1f53abfbef3fdedb/spec/performance/analysis.json), updated [benchmarks](https://github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks/).
- Released enopy 0.2.8 with a fix for a regression in enopy tokenization, set up a tokenization snapshot test scenario for future prevention.
- Added comprehensive unit tests for enopy's `List` class, released yet another enopy patch release (0.2.9) addressing an older, undiscovered regression.

**Tuesday, June 26 2018**

- Started collecting and evaluating test coverage for all eno implementations (currently 66% for enojs, 37% for enopy and 80% for enorb)
- Added some specs for enojs' `Value` class and a fix for a discovered regression.
- Officially graduated enorb from Alpha to Beta status due to coverage and observed stability during usage in the last week.
- Performance optimization release enopy 0.2.7, adressing post-opening block consumption and later allocation with [1-2.7x speed gains](https://github.com/eno-lang/enopy/blob/b884b80011c8af0301dd521396140a240a9eac96/tests/benchmark/analysis.json), updated [benchmarks](https://github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks/).

**Monday, June 25 2018**

- Performance optimization releases enorb 0.4.4 and enopy 0.2.5, both addressing block content parser performance, with [1-16x speed gains for ruby](https://github.com/eno-lang/enorb/blob/4b8332a2a94061c586084c92bb229be6678d77e4/spec/benchmark/analysis.json) and [1-39x speed gains for python](https://github.com/eno-lang/enopy/blob/64fb14979ea881969a317463b37c4f755bfaa497/tests/benchmark/analysis.json)
- Re-evaluated and updated the global benchmark report at [github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks](https://github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks/)
- More optimizations (enorb 0.4.5, enopy 0.2.6), this time addressing token extraction performance, with [1-2.3x speed gains for ruby](https://github.com/eno-lang/enorb/blob/010be1cdc2efc75ee28b06503a8be8bce1ea1bd6/spec/benchmark/analysis.json) and [1-2.5x speed gains for python](https://github.com/eno-lang/enopy/blob/cb87f11593c87d34c287288ed92004c7893688b8/tests/benchmark/analysis.json), [benchmarks](https://github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks/) updated again.
- Completed the last missing feature texts on the Advanced Features page.
- Improved the [interactive demo](https://eno-lang.org/demo/) layout to make better use of screen space, updated some code snippets.

**Sunday, June 24 2018**

- An [enorb-exploaders](https://rubygems.org/gems/enorb-exploaders) gem is now available as well (with the same featureset as its js/py siblings).
- Improved clarity for some first impression texts on the frontpage (thanks to Dan Haiduc for feedback!).
- New benchmark report at [github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks](https://github.com/eno-lang/benchmarks/) with an additional scenario added that evaluates performance for content-heavy data.

**Saturday, June 23 2018**

- An [experimental enopy loaders](https://test.pypi.org/project/enopy-exploaders/) package is now available too (with the same featureset as its js sibling).
- Refactored the test structure for enopy, test coverage for enopy's `Value` class added, released 0.2.4 with small fixes.

 **Friday, June 22 2018**
 
 - **The website now has a dev blog and more contact options. ヽ(^o^)ノ**
