# About

## Abstract

eno is a structured, plain-text notation language, related in many ways to its
ancestors and relatives *JSON*, *YAML*, *TOML*, *ArchieML*, *StrictYAML*, and
others. Through its simple syntax and versatile nature it targets a wide
audience, both in regards to cultural background as well as technical ability.
Backed by officially maintained, thoroughly engineered open source libraries and
plugins it allows usage on a wide variety of platforms and for many, diverse
usecases. As a modern foundational technology for file-based content it enables
more productive and more reliable application development, and the possibility
to create file-based applications for a wider and more diverse user audience
than was previously possible.

## History

The eno notation language exists since early 2018, where it surfaced in an
extended period of applied research and development in a large project around
file-based content. Initially developed in
[JavaScript](https://eno-lang.org/javascript/), the eno libraries now already
extend to the [Python](https://eno-lang.org/python/),
[Ruby](https://eno-lang.org/ruby/), and soon
[PHP](https://github.com/eno-lang/enophp) platforms. Asides the language design
and its implementations there already are official and complete [learning
resources](https://eno-lang.org/language/) for the language itself, syntax
highlighting support for [Atom](https://eno-lang.org/atom/), [Visual Studio Code](https://eno-lang.org/vscode/) and
[Sublime Text](https://eno-lang.org/sublime/), and much more in the making.
