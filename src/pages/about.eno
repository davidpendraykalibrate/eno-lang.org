# About

## Overview

- eno is a **structured, plain-text notation** language, related in many ways to its ancestors and relatives *JSON*, *YAML*, *TOML*, *ArchieML*, and others
- Through its **simple syntax and versatile nature** it targets a wide audience, both in regards to cultural background as well as technical ability
- Documents authored as eno comprise of *elements* that map to **ubiquitous structural types** in all programing languages
- On a syntactic level there are no types in eno, **only textual representations**
- eno provides a high-grade **API to validate and obtain fully customizable types** on the application level instead
- All eno implementations feature **100% internationalized, hand written, human language error messages**
- eno allows **sequential and associative reading**, you can seamlessly blend between configuration/metadata and content in a single document
- There is no indentation and **all whitespace is optional**, as are empty lines

## History

The eno notation language exists since early 2018, where it surfaced in an
extended period of applied research and development of a large project around
file-based content. Initially developed in
[JavaScript](https://eno-lang.org/javascript/), the eno libraries now already
extend to the [Python](https://eno-lang.org/python/) and
[Ruby](https://eno-lang.org/ruby/) platforms. Asides the language design and its
implementations there already are official and complete [learning
resources](https://eno-lang.org/language/) for the language itself, syntax
highlighting support for [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/language-eno/) and
[Sublime Text](https://github.org/eno-lang/sublime-eno/), and much more in the
making.
