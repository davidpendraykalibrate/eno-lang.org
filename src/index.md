## Learn eno

eno is very simple, in about 5 minutes you'll be ready to create any content you wish!

Go to [eno-lang.org/learn](https://eno-lang.org/learn/)

## Write your content with eno

Every operating system comes with a text editor - that's all you need! However, dedicated eno plugins for text editors make editing more fun and productive by highlighting the elements in a document in different colors, augmenting our visual grasp on our content.

Rust and PHP are likely candidates for late 2018, but what lands on the definite roadmap will also
depend on your feedback, so make yourself heard if you have suggestions or questions!
